             Player 2 draws: Queen of Spades, Jack of Diamonds, 4 Diamonds, 3 Diamonds, and Ace of Clubs 
             Player 3 draws: Jack of Diamonds, 10 Hearts, 4 Clubs, 2 Spades, and Ace of Spades
             Player 4 draws: 10 Diamonds, 6 Clubs, 5 Spades, 3 Hearts, and 2 Hearts.
             
            Player 1 Wins the Game!
            
Walkthrough: Player 1's hand is consisted of points: 13 + 12 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 37
             Player 2's hand is consisted of points: 12 + 11 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 31
             Player 3's hand is consisted of points: 11 + 10 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 28
             Player 4's hand is consisted of points: 10 + 6 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 26
             
             Since Player 1 gains the highest points Player 1 wins the game. 
 
              However, if one or more players went above the winning limit, they lose the game.
